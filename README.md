## 1. Project Overview

AVAA (Assistant for Vaccination Appointments and Analytics) is a proof-of-concept application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to demonstrate a functional end-to-end system for managing vaccination appointments and analytics.

The backend is developed with Express.js, interfacing with a local MongoDB database to handle CRUD operations for user profiles, demographic data, appointment records, and vaccine/hospital listings. The frontend is built with React.js, leveraging reusable components and React-Bootstrap for responsive UI design.

Users can:
- Log in to their accounts.
- Browse available vaccines and hospitals.
- Request vaccination appointments.
- View their past and upcoming appointments.
- Pay for upcoming appointments.

Additionally, users with administrator privileges can create new vaccine listings and approve pending appointments. As a personal design-choice, records are unable to be deleted by patients or medical administrators.

Basic analytics, such as demographic distributions by gender, age, and profession, are publicly accessible to all visitors on the default landing page.
